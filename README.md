# CVRP-capacitated-vehicle-routing-problem
We use a cluster-first, route-second approach. We find a solution for the CVRP with a constructive method and then we try to improve this solution using an iterative method. This idea may lead to a locally optimal solution due to the local search approach of the iterative method.
